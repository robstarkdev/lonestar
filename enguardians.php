        According to American law international students in the US who are under the age of 18 must have a legal guardian to handle various matters on their parents behalf.  This can relate to such matters as signing contracts, approving emergency medical care, authorizing the opening of accounts, and myriad dealings with schools and other third parties.

        Lonestar provides the highest-quality guardians which are thoroughly screened and vetted prior to being approved.  We do background checks and we know all of our limited number of guardians very well.
