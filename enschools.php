        To begin with, it’s worth noting that absolutely all of the pictures you see here are real, actual pictures of students, classes and the actual schools themselves.  If you see a picture of a group of students: that is a real picture from an actual class or event at one of our schools!  There are no marketing tricks or gimmicks here!  Most of the schools in the cities where we have homes have some affiliation with a particular church or Christian denomination.  In fact, historically, many of the best high schools in America have had some connection to a religious denomination.  Under American law, public universities and colleges are not allowed to have a religious affiliation.  However, this law (which was created at the time of the founding of the nation over two hundred years ago) does not apply to private schools and colleges under most circumstances.  Thus, historically many of the best schools for primary and high school students have been private Christian-based schools.
