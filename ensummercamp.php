        We have a summer ESL (English as a Second Language) camp coming in 2017!  Your kids will be immersed in English language and American culture for our two sessions:<br><br>
        <span style="color: black; font-size: 1.1em; background-color: lightblue;"><strong>Session 1</strong></span>: June 10th-30th (from Monday to Friday students are in class from 8:15 am until 12:15 pm in the afternoon, on Friday the class schedule changes because on those days we take trips and do fun things at parks and in the city)<br><br>
        <span style="color: black; font-size: 1.1em; background-color: lightblue;"><strong>Session 2</strong></span>: July 10th-28th (from Monday to Friday students are in class from 8:15 am until 12:15 pm in the afternoon, on Friday the class schedule changes because on those days we take trips and do fun things at parks and in the city)<br><br>
        Our program provides over one month of American English learning at the Willow Bend Academy in Plano, Texas.  We separate the students into different groups based on their current English skills/ability.  On each Friday we take special trips to such places as Water Parks, Museums etc..<br><br>

        In our programs students use English all day, both in and out of class.  This includes the activities that happen outside of the classroom: English is used at all times.  Spoken/oral English is required at all times.  There is substantial interaction with both local teachers and the people locally here in Texas.<br><br>

        All students will have their English level tested and assessed at the beginning of the course.  We focus on oral English.  They are then put into different levels based on the results of the assessment/test.  We have three different levels into which we place students at the beginning of the summer camp: beginning, intermediate, and advanced. We then assess the students at the end of the program to see the amount of progress that has been made during the one-month intensive program.<br><br>

        In the afternoons we have activities that involve the entire group of students so that there is a good social element to our program.  We believe it is important to regularly and consistently have the students go out into the local American society and culture to remind them that what they are studying is real.  When they go to a local restaurant or a park with local Americans speaking natural American English this tends to reinforce what your child has just learned that day earlier in a classroom.<br><br>

        We have a set price for this program that includes everything: <span style="color: green; font-size: 1.1em; background-color: yellow;"><strong>45,000 renminbi per student</strong></span>.  This fee covers everything a student participating in the program needs: tuition, food, transportation, orientation, trips/events, books, and of course housing.  During the time when the students are not in an actual classroom they will still be living, speaking, and interacting with local Americans in a natural English environment.  The total program lasts from early June to late July.  Your child will spend more than half the summer learning in America.
