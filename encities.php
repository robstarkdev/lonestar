        All of our cities are located within the Dallas-Fort Worth region.  The region is a large area of closely linked cities which together form a “metropolitan area”.  There are approximately 7,000,000 people living in the various cities which make up the region.  Our schools and homes are located in five smaller cities.  You can see on the map below the red arrows pointing to the five cities in the northern area of the Dallas-Forth Worth area. It is important to note that most of the crime occurs far away from our cities.  Most of the residents in these five cities have high incomes and the areas have low crime rates in general.

        <strong>Plano, Texas</strong><br>

        Plano is known for having one of the largest proportions of Chinese residents of
        any city in of America.  While the total population within the city’s legal boundary is just
        270,000, there are an estimated 30,000 Chinese people living in the city.  That means that about 10% of the population is Chinese.  The government census does not record the full number of Chinese actually living
        in the area: 5.2%.  In fact it is known that most Chinese do not participate in the
        census and most knowledgable observers have concluded that the number
        recorded in the census of 14,200 Chinese is only about half of the total number.
        Regardless of whose statistics you prefer, even a percentage of 5% (not the actual
        10%) is quite large.  This can make your child’s stay in America even more
        comfortable.  They will have the sense that they are not “alone” in America and
        all paths are open to them in the professional and social world.  There
        are six Chinese churches in the Plano area.  In 2007 the median family income in
        Plano was $101,616 USD per year.  It is wealthier than most parts of America.

        <strong>Mkinney, Allen, Frisco</strong><br>

        As with all of the cities we deal with, these three cities have wonderful weather: sunny and warm.  Mkinney is the largest of the three with 168,000 residents.  Allen has a population of 84,000.  Frisco has 116,000 people living within it’s city limits.  These are all safe cities with low crime rates and high average incomes.  Your children are more likely to interact with well-educated Americans if they live in one of our five cities where we have homes/host families.  All of our cities are within about 30 miles of downtown Dallas (the main city center of Dallas).
